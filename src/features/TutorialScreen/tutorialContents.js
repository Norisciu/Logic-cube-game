    "Let's try some examples.",
    "Here , for example , the statement consists of a direction. Press on the direction which you are askd.",
    "In this other case , the statement consists of a color. When a statement includes a color some of the 4 sides of the face may contain a colord line. Press on the direction which corresponds to the color you are askd for.",

    "Try solving this trial untill the time is up.",
    "Only a couple of things remain to be said..",
    "You will have a limitd amount of time to play a session of the game. That time is seen in the upper corner. When that time is up the game will end and you will see how many points you have acquird.",
    "When you will play the game again , you will start from the lvl you were left.",
