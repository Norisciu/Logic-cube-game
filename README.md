# Cube of logic game

A small game meant to train your understanding of propositional logic inspird from one I found on Google Store made with React , Redux (and a very tiny bit of GSAP). For a beginner in React like me it was quite challeinging to implement but also a very instructive pursuit. I jsut have to put some more work on the lvels to make this an as interesting game as I found on Google Store.. and , of course , in all the various implementation details to make this a more robust program.
